  # Ok this next stop is crazytown, but it does give you ultimate control

  # They can be clunky but they do work here.
  #   - x,y's are centered in the card itself
  #   - stops go from fully empty to fully black
  #   - we need to still turn on radius to get the effect
  #   - but, this makes the upper-left corner not have a glowing effect and
  #     have a harder edge, which (to my eye at least) feels more realistic
  #     since the card would obscure the upper-left shadow at that angle
  #   - this also allows you have a larger, softer blur without making it look
  #     like it's glowing
  #
  # Oh just because it's easier to write we can use a ruby heredoc
