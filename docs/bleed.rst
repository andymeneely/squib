Always Have Bleed
=================

.. note::

  TODO: Under construction

* Always plan to have a printing bleed around the edge of your cards. 1/8 in is standard
* Have a safe zone too
* Layouts make this easy (see the built-in layouts)
* Can use png overlays from templates to make sure it fits
* Trim option is what is used everywhere in Squib
* Trim_radius also lets you show your cards off like how they'll really look
