Squib in Action
===============

Squib is in use by a lot of people! You can learn a lot from looking at how a whole project is put together.

A good way to peruse Squib code is to search for Ruby files on GitHub that have the phrase ``require 'squib'`` in them. And these are the just the people who have decided to release their code open source!

My Projects
-----------

Here are some of my own board and card games that use Squib. They are all under "active" development, which means that sometimes I leave them alone for long periods of time ;)

  * `Your Last Heist <http://github.com/andymeneely/project-timber-wolf>`_ is a big-box cooperative game. Lots of really cool Squib things in here, including lots of Rake features, color+bw, and showing how skills can "level up" on their backs by diff'ing the stats in Squib. You can see what the components look like at `the game website <http://yourlastheist.com>`_. Also: the best game I've ever made.
  * `Victory Point Salad <https://github.com/andymeneely/victory-point-salad>`_. A card-only game with lots and lots and lots of cards. Pretty straightforward as far as Squib usage goes, but it's a good peek into how I like to use Squib. Also: the funniest game I've made.
  * `Junk Land <https://github.com/andymeneely/junk-land>`_ A game I made prior to making starting Squib, but then ported over to Squib while developing Squib. Uses some strange features of SVG, but also a good intro. Also: the scrappiest game I've made.

Other Projects using Squib
--------------------------

Poking around GitHub, here are a few sightings of Squib:

  * `Ecovalia <https://github.com/evolve2k/ecovalia-game>`_ - a game rapidly prototyped in a hackathon. Squib is featured in their video!
  * `Werewolf <https://github.com/Xpktro/werewolf>`_ implemented and even uses GitHub releases!
  * `Cult Following <https://github.com/ericathegreat/Cult-Following>`_ is a neat-looking project
  * ScrapyardArmory's `Dysplacement <https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/dysplacement>`_ was used with Squib, and **won** the `Worker Placement contest <https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/dysplacement>`_ over at TheGameCrafter.
  * `Mad World <https://github.com/spilth/madworld>`_ uses CircleCI to build, even with some custom fonts.
