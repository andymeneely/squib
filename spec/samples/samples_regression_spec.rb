  # This test could use some explanation
  # Much of the development of Squib has been sample-driven. Every time I want
  # new syntax or feature, I write a sample, get it working, and then write
  # tests for boundary cases in the unit tests.
  #
  # This makes documentation much easier and example-driven.
  # ...but I want to use those samples for regression & integration tests too.
  #
  # The above test is a good smoke test, but it just looks for exceptions.
  # What this set of tests do is run the samples again, but mocking out Cairo,
  # Pango, RSVG, and any other dependencies. We log those API calls and store
  # them in a super-verbose string. We compare our runs against what happened
  # before.
  #
  # Thus, if we ever change anything that results in a ANY change to our
  # regression logs, then these tests will fail. If it's SURPRISING, then we
  # caught an integration bug. If it's not, just update and overwrite the logs.
  #
  # So it's understood that you should have to periodically enable the
  # overwrite_sample method below to store the new regression log. Just make
  # sure you inspect the change and make sure it makes sense with the change
  # you made to the samples or Squib.
  # FOR NOW!! These two I can't get working on Travis, so I'm disabling
