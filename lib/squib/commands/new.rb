This is the advanced layout designed for larger games. Everything is
organized into separate directories and the workflow is all based on
the Rakefile.

From within this directory, run `bundle install` to install extra
gems.

After that,  run `rake` to build. Check out the Rakefile for more.

Happy Squibbing! And best of luck with your game.
