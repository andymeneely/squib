# Settings in the config.yml are overriding Squib's defaults. Anything in the main script will override this.

# DPI is used in making PDFs and in unit conversions
# Default: 300
#dpi: 72

#antialias: best #recommended. Only about 10% slower than fast
#antialias: default # set the anti-aliasing algorithm. default defers to the underlying graphics device. See http://www.cairographics.org/manual/cairo-cairo-t.html#cairo-antialias-t

# Text hints are used to show the boundaries of text boxes.
# Can be enabled/disabled at the command-level, or set globally with `set`
#text_hint: '#F00'

# Show progress bars on the command line for potentially long-running operations
#progress_bars: true

#Enable some custom colors that can be used in any color
#custom_colors:
#  foo: '#abc'

#For reading image file command (e.g. png and svg), read from this directory instead
#img_dir: img-color
#img_dir: img-bw

# Use a SVG cairo back end, instead of an in-memory buffer
# backend: :memory # default
# backend: :svg    # can create scalable pdfs, but rendering done at the printer level is not as good as Cairo.

# Configure what text markup uses replace characters
# Below are the defaults
# lsquote: "\u2018" #note that Yaml wants double quotes here to use escape chars
# rsquote: "\u2019"
# ldquote: "\u201C"
# rdquote: "\u201D"
# em_dash: "\u2014"
# en_dash: "\u2013"
# ellipsis: "\u2026"

# We can also disallow smart quotes and only allow explicit replacements with ``LaTeX-style'' quotes.
# smart_quotes: false

# By default, Squib warns when a text box is ellipsized. This can get verbose
# and can be turned off here
# warn_ellipsize: true # default
# warn_ellipsize: false # turn off entirely

# By default, Squib will warn if a PNG is being up-scaled.
# warn_png_scale: true # default
# warn_png_scale: false # turn off entirely
